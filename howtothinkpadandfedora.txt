I purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad P52s and installed Fedora Workstatopn 40 on it. I want to document the steps I had to go thru for this in case I need to do it again in the future.

1. Using Fedora MediaWriter I created a bootable USB stick with Fedora Workstation 40 on it.

2. I connected the USB stick to the P52s and booted into the Fedora installation program.

3. During the installation make sure to choose to overwrite the entire disk.

4. Once installation is complete, reboot and login and run 'dnf' command from the cli to make sure you have the latest updates.

5. Install the correct NVIDIA graphics drivers. This repo has a utility that will guide you thru the process: https://github.com/gridhead/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora-linux.

6. Install other apps and utilities as required: Chrome, Alacritty, Zed, Espanso, zsh, oh-my-zsh, neoVim, etc.

7. Install the MesloLS NF font from here: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k

8. Install GNOME Tweaks and enable sub pixel rendering.

9. For Alacritty make sure that the themes directory is cloned. See https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme.
